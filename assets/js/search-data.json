    "content": "| Disclaimer: | . | The analyses focused only on price for hardware and were done while working on a proof of concept version of Basic RUM that solves some basic business use cases. This doesn’t include the time spent for setting up the hardware and building dashboards. There is a hidden cost and at this point it will be naive to compare Basic RUM with commercial tools that provide, 24/7 support, implement failover mechanisms and provide professional services. | . We run some tests based on real users traffic and for the cost of about 18.50 Euro a month a website with 50 000 views a day / 1.5 million views a month could be efficiently monitored. The tests we run on the cheapest HETZNER Cloud servers - CX11 (1 vCPU Intel, 2 GB RAM, 20 GB disk space). Also a HETZNER Load balancer was added which contributed to the final price. | # | Service | Instance type | Price | . | 1 | Beacon catcher and beacons decoder | CX11 | 4.15 € / monthly | . | 2 | Grafana | CX11 | 4.15 € / monthly | . | 3 | ClickHouse | CX11 | 4.15 € / monthly | . | 4 | Load balancer | CX11 | 5.83 € / monthly | . |   |   |   | 18.28 € / monthly | . Note: The prices were taken on October 18th 2021. In the future the prices could change. The cost could be reduced even more: . | Reduce 5.83 € / monthly - The Load balancer could be removed. We used it because it was more practical and easier to install SSL certificates. | . ",

The performance information is sent over a beacon to the Beacon Catcher server. | The Beacon Catcher server persists beacons in a raw format in a temporary storage prepared for reading and decoding on the nex. | The beacon decoding service reads a batch of raw beacons, decodes them and prepares the decoded beacon data for inserting in ClickHouse DB. | The raw beacons are bundled, compressed and stored in a file system. The stored beacons could be used as a backup or re-imported in case we add new columns in ClickHouse DB. | The decoded beacon data is inserted in a flat table in ClickHouse DB. Columns in this table for example are: Time To First Byte (TTFB), First Input Delay (FID), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and others. | Grafana visualizes performance information by querying ClickHouse DB. We have a bunch of pre-backed dashboards that visualize Core Web Vitals and other performance data in histograms, percentile, barcharts and more. | . ",
