    "content": "How did Basic RUM begin? . Hi everyone! . I’m Tsvetan, and a few years back, I started working on Basic RUM as a fun side project. In 2019, I joined Akamai, but in 2017, I was part of a team running a webshop using Magento. We wanted to find ways to make more revenue, so I wondered if making the webshop faster would help. Our backend servers were already pretty well optimized, so I started looking at other things. I learned about ways to make the website faster for users. These tricks went beyond just the Time to First Byte stuff but were touching the front-end. The catch was, my colleagues and I were used to working with backend code, and these new tricks were about the front-end of the website. We thought about learning these cool front-end tricks, but then we asked ourselves, “How can we prove they actually make things better?” Also, I remember reading that moving all the JavaScript to the end of the webpage could make the page show up faster. But a few months later, I read that people were saying this was a bad practice. At the same time, we had a bunch of other things to work on for different departments. I wanted to make sure our ideas made sense and fit with the company’s plans. That’s when I realized we could really use something that measures how fast the website feels for the end user. Well, that’s what Real User Monitoring (RUM) is all about. I looked into different products that provide RUM, but most of the options were too expensive for our budget back then. So, during my free time, I started learning about Boomerang JS, which is a tool that grabs information about how fast a website works from people’s web browsers. I also figured out how to collect and show the data in dashboards. And that’s the story of how Basic RUM came to be – a project that started from my curiosity and turned into something pretty cool! .

There is a hidden cost and at this point it will be naive to compare Basic RUM with commercial tools that provide, 24/7 support, implement failover mechanisms and provide professional services. | . We run some tests based on real users traffic and for the cost of about 18.50 Euro a month a website with 50 000 views a day / 1.5 million views a month could be efficiently monitored.

The performance information is sent over a beacon to the Beacon Catcher server. | The Beacon Catcher server persists beacons in a raw format in a temporary storage prepared for reading and decoding on the nex. | The beacon decoding service reads a batch of raw beacons, decodes them and prepares the decoded beacon data for inserting in ClickHouse DB. | The raw beacons are bundled, compressed and stored in a file system. The stored beacons could be used as a backup or re-imported in case we add new columns in ClickHouse DB. | The decoded beacon data is inserted in a flat table in ClickHouse DB. Columns in this table for example are: Time To First Byte (TTFB), First Input Delay (FID), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and others. | Grafana visualises performance information by querying ClickHouse DB. We have a bunch of pre-backed dashboards that visualise Core Web Vitals and other performance data in histograms, percentile, barcharts and more. | . ",
